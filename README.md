# Inventory-Tracker

- The purpose of this repo is to create an inventory tracking system.

- This will include an algorithm that will reorder products before new products run out of stock.

# System Components:

# Backend Database

- SQL Lite (However, depending on the use of the application it may need to be scaled to PostgreSQL or MySQL in the future.)
# Backend Logic (Python) 

- Track current inventory.
- Determine when is the optimal time to reorder.
- Place reorders.
- Flask (Chosen due to it's built in features that I think would be helfpul in this case.)
- FastAPI (I may decide to use FastAPI as well, but this is still preliminary.)

# Frontend (React)
  - The goal is to create a login screen that will allow users to login in to the application.
  - There will also be a basic display that will show current product levels for that specific user. 
    
# Version Control (Git, Github)
